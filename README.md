# SanFranFiasco.github.io
On a mission to build a portfolio website showcasing my growth in front end development, UX design, programming, and blogging

Please feel free to pick at my understanding of programming, design, and technique.
My intention is to learn and master how to write "beautiful" and "thoughtful" code
and master good design techniques and strategies. I would be very much obliged if
you would review and critique my code. Please feel free to communicate and contribute!
